# caesarCipher

This really cool type of cipher called a  Caesar Cipher works as follows: You take your message, something like "hello" and then you shift all of the letters by a certain offset. For example, if I chose an offset of 3 and a message of "hello", I would code my message by shifting each letter 3 places to the left (with respect to the alphabet). So "h" becomes "e", "e" becomes, "b", "l" becomes "i", and "o" becomes "l". Then I have my coded message,"ebiil"! Now you can send any message and the offset and you can decode it. The best thing is that Julius Caesar himself used this cipher, that's why it's called the Caesar Cipher!
